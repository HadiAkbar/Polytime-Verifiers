ðŸ§  Polytime Verifiers for NP Problems This repository contains Python implementations of polynomial-time verifiers for three classic NP decision problems:

PACKING â€“ Verifies if a subset of weights fits within a given lower and upper bound.

SUBSETSUM â€“ Verifies if a given subset sums exactly to the target value.

PARTITION â€“ Verifies if a given subset splits the list into two equal-sum partitions.
