Polytime Verifiers for NP Problems This repository contains Python implementations of polynomial-time verifiers for three classic NP decision problems:

PACKING – Verifies if a subset of weights fits within a given lower and upper bound.

SUBSETSUM – Verifies if a given subset sums exactly to the target value.

PARTITION – Verifies if a given subset splits the list into two equal-sum partitions.
